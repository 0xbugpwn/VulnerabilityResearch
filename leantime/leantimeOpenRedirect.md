#### POC

> The "Tag" field in the To-Do feature is vulnerable to XSS. By using a JS script, an attacker can exploit an Open Redirect vulnerability.

The exploit poisons the To-Dos section, preventing all users and the admin from accessing it, with a permanent redirection. Consequently, they will no longer be able to view their To-Dos or add new ones. The attacker can redirect users to a malicious site or execute scripts in their browsers.

Go to To-Dos

![To-Do1](data/todo1.png)

Add a To-Do

![To-Do2](data/todo2.png)

Give it a name.
In the Tag field, insert the JS script.

```js
<script>window.location.replace("http://example.org/")</script>
```
